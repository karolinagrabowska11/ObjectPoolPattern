# ObjectPoolPattern

Project consists of 3 Object Pools that represents 3 types of configurable and complex calculations.

I use Prototype Pattern to create new object in a pool and Builder Pattern to create thread that take specified number of pool objects, performs calculations.
After completing the calculations thread returns objects to the pool and it ends.
